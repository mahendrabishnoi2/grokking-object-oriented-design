# Design a Hotel Management System

Let's design a hotel management system.

A Hotel Management System is a software built to handle all online hotel activities easily and safely. This System will
give the hotel management power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online portal. The system
allows the manager to keep track of all the available rooms in the system as well as to book rooms and generate bills.

### System Requirements

We’ll focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Hotel Management System:

1. The system should support the booking of different room types like standard, deluxe, family suite, etc.
2. Guests should be able to search the room inventory and book any available room.
3. The system should be able to retrieve information, such as who booked a particular room, or what rooms were booked by
   a specific customer.
4. The system should allow customers to cancel their booking - and provide them with a full refund if the cancelation
   occurs before 24 hours of the check-in date.
5. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the booking is nearing the check-in or check-out date.
6. The system should maintain a room housekeeping log to keep track of all housekeeping tasks.
7. Any customer should be able to add room services and food items.
8. Customers can ask for different amenities.
9. The customers should be able to pay their bills through credit card, check or cash.

### Use case diagram

Here are the main Actors in our system:

- **Guest:** All guests can search the available rooms, as well as make a booking.
- **Receptionist:** Mainly responsible for adding and modifying rooms, creating room bookings, check-in, and check-out
  customers.
- **System:** Mainly responsible for sending notifications for room booking, cancellation, etc.
- **Manager:** Mainly responsible for adding new workers.
- **Housekeeper:** To add/modify housekeeping record of rooms.
- **Server:** To add/modify room service record of rooms.

Here are the top use cases of the Hotel Management System:

- **Add/Remove/Edit room:** To add, remove, or modify a room in the system.
- **Search room:** To search for rooms by type and availability.
- **Register or cancel an account:** To add a new member or cancel the membership of an existing member.
- **Book room:** To book a room.
- **Check-in:** To let the guest check-in for their booking.
- **Check-out:** To track the end of the booking and the return of the room keys.
- **Add room charge:** To add a room service charge to the customer’s bill.
- **Update housekeeping log:** To add or update the housekeeping entry of a room.

### Class diagram

Here are the main classes of our Hotel Management System:

- **Hotel and HotelLocation:** Our system will support multiple locations of a hotel.
- **Room:** The basic building block of the system. Every room will be uniquely identified by the room number. Each Room
  will have attributes like Room Style, Booking Price, etc.
- **Account:** We will have different types of accounts in the system: one will be a guest to search and book rooms,
  another will be a receptionist. Housekeeping will keep track of the housekeeping records of a room, and a Server will
  handle room service.
- **RoomBooking:** This class will be responsible for managing bookings for a room.
- **Notification:** Will take care of sending notifications to guests.
- **RoomHouseKeeping:** To keep track of all housekeeping records for rooms.
- **RoomCharge:** Encapsulates the details about different types of room services that guests have requested.
- **Invoice:** Contains different invoice-items for every charge against the room.
- **RoomKey:** Each room can be assigned an electronic key card. Keys will have a barcode and will be uniquely
  identified by a key-ID.

### Code

Here is the high-level definition for the classes described above.

**Enums, data types, and constants:** Here are the required enums, data types, and constants:

```java
public enum RoomStyle {
    STANDARD, DELUXE, FAMILY_SUITE, BUSINESS_SUITE
}

public enum RoomStatus {
    AVAILABLE, RESERVED, OCCUPIED, NOT_AVAILABLE, BEING_SERVICED, OTHER
}

public enum BookingStatus {
    REQUESTED, PENDING, CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN, CHECKED_OUT, CANCELLED, ABANDONED
}

public enum AccountStatus {
    ACTIVE, CLOSED, CANCELED, BLACKLISTED, BLOCKED
}

public enum AccountType {
    MEMBER, GUEST, MANAGER, RECEPTIONIST
}

public enum PaymentStatus {
    UNPAID, PENDING, COMPLETED, FILLED, DECLINED, CANCELLED, ABANDONED, SETTLING, SETTLED, REFUNDED
}

public class Address {
    private String streetAddress;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipCode;
    private String country;
}
```

**Account, Person, Guest, Receptionist, and Server:** These classes represent the different people that interact with
our system:

```java
// For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can
// assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective
// public getter method and modified only through their public setter method.

public class Account {
    private String id;
    private String password;
    private AccountStatus status;

    public boolean resetPassword();
}

public abstract class Person {
    private String name;
    private Address address;
    private String email;
    private String phone;

    private Account account;
}


public class Guest extends Person {
    private int totalRoomsCheckedIn;

    public List<RoomBooking> getBookings();
}

public class Receptionist extends Person {
    public List<Member> searchMember(String name);

    public boolean createBooking();
}

public class Server extends Person {
    public boolean addRoomCharge(Room room, RoomCharge roomCharge);
}
```

**Hotel and HotelLocation:** These classes represent the top-level classes of the system:

```java
public class HotelLocation {
    private String name;
    private Address location;

    public Address getRooms();
}

public class Hotel {
    private String name;
    private List<HotelLocation> locations;

    public boolean addLocation(HotelLocation location);
}
```

**Room, RoomKey, and RoomHouseKeeping:** To encapsulate a room, room key, and housekeeping:

```java
public interface Search {
    public static List<Room> search(RoomStyle style, Date startDate, int duration);
}

public class Room implements Search {
    private String roomNumber;
    private RoomStyle style;
    private RoomStatus status;
    private double bookingPrice;
    private boolean isSmoking;

    private List<RoomKey> keys;
    private List<RoomHouseKeeping> houseKeepingLog;

    public boolean isRoomAvailable();

    public boolean checkIn();

    public boolean checkOut();

    public static List<Room> search(RoomStyle style, Date startDate, int duration) {
// return all rooms with the given style and availability
    }
}

public class RoomKey {
    private String keyId;
    private String barcode;
    private Date issuedAt;
    private boolean active;
    private boolean isMaster;

    public boolean assignRoom(Room room);

    public boolean isActive();
}

public class RoomHouseKeeping {
    private String description;
    private Date startDatetime;
    private int duration;
    private HouseKeeper houseKeeper;

    public boolean addHouseKeeping(Room room);
}
```

**RoomBooking and RoomCharge:** To encapsulate a booking and different charges against a booking:

```java
public class RoomBooking {
    private String reservationNumber;
    private Date startDate;
    private int durationInDays;
    private BookingStatus status;
    private Date checkin;
    private Date checkout;

    private int guestID;
    private Room room;
    private Invoice invoice;
    private List<Notification> notifications;

    public static RoomBooking fectchDetails(String reservationNumber);
}

public abstract class RoomCharge {
    public Date issueAt;

    public boolean addInvoiceItem(Invoice invoice);
}

public class Amenity extends RoomCharge {
    public String name;
    public String description;
}

public class RoomService extends RoomCharge {
    public boolean isChargeable;
    public Date requestTime;
}

public class KitchenService extends RoomCharge {
    public String description;
}
```
